// Pseudocode
//if board is full and no player has won, game ends in a draw
//numPlayers must be min 2 or max 4.
	// can initialize array to length of 4 then check that 2 are not null.
// get player names, use for loop to check for duplicates
// store names in an array, if new player == a name in array then prompt for a new name
// prompt players to choose between 4-10 rows and 4-10 columns for game board

//Player
// create constructor that sets player's names and numbers to instance variables'
// create getName() method and getPlayerNumber() method-- player number represents player token (1 = player1 etc.)
// create makeMove method() -- prompt user for the column they want to drop their token in, then return the value
